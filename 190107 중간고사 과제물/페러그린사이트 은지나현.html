                    <p>One day, Jake is told by his grandfather who is dying with his eyes pulled out, to visit Miss Peregrine. On Jake's birthday, he found Miss Peregrine's letter in a book his grandfather left before he died, visits a ruined house in an island in the name of helping cure his mental illness. Jake meets children in there, and they take him through a portal in a cave and he emerges in the year 1943 when the house was still intact. He finds out she and the children hide from the outside world in a time loop she created, accessible only to Peculiars and set to September 3, 1943. Also, after that, he recognizes he has inherited his grandfather's ability to see “hollows”. Peregrine feels threat through the Avocet’s case which is attacked by the hollows and plans to make a new loop and tells the children to pack their own belongs. Emma gets into conflict with Jake who can't go with her, and Jake goes back to the present.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>Jake, who returns to the present, sees an old man dead at a cliff with no eyes, and heads for the loop to inform Peregrine about the situation. But the photographer, who strangely hovered around him, followed him to the cave and Jake found out that he is the leader of the hollows, Barron. Barron shows his true colors, and even invade Peregrine's house and took Jake as a hostage and threat Peregrine. Eventually, Peregrine says goodbye to her children and is locked in a cage herself. As other hollows try to attack the children, Jake recognizes that he is the only one who can see them. Jake makes the children run away through a window that located in 2nd floor. After the children run away, as their house is hit by the bomb and explode with Harlow, the loop disappears.
                        </p>
    
                      <p>All the children are safe, but Baron is disappeared from the island with a ship aboard Miss Peregrine. Jake and children are planning to go to Blackpool, where Baron headed, using a shipwreck in the sea. When Jake and children arrive at the closed dock, they go into another loop and go to a theme park. Jake and his group decoy Barron and hollows to the theme park and fight back. During the fight, Barron heads to Peregrine and Ymbrynes, and Emma takes time to keep him away by blowing a strong wind until Jake unlock the lock. Just before Barron gets in, Jake succeeds in opening the cage. When Barron gets mad at the fall of his plan and, tries to hurt Jake, Enoch and Emma come in with crossbow. 
                        </p>
    
                      <p>However, Enoch are confused as to who to shoot because Barron transformed into Jake’s appearance. When Jake saw an undead hollow behind Barron, he said, he’ll prove himself. And then the hollow eats fake Jake’s eyeballs which is Barron’s. When Hollow, who eats Baron's eyes, even targets Jake, Enoch throws the crossbow to Jake, and Jake shoots the hollow. Jake says good-bye to the children when it is time for the loop to close and finds out that his grandfather is alive because Barron and hollows are already dead. When he goes to his grandfather's house to explain the whole story, he gives him a map with a loop on it and told him to find Emma. Jake uses the map to search for loops around the world, and arrives at the dock in years, and reunites with children in the wrecks of the pier.
